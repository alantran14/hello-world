## Welcome to my first website

My name is Alan. This is my first website I am building using GitHub.

### Here is a quick Number Theory and Algebra question


```markdown

**Division Algorithm**
If a, b are integers and b > 0, then 

           a = qb + r
for unique integers q, r with 
```

- q is the quotient and r is the remainder.
- Note that:

### Example

              24 = 2 x 10 + 4
          
The **greatest common divisor** d = gcd(a,b) is the integer satisfying

### Example

               gcd(24,10) = 2

### HTML Coding Stuff

```markdown

This is created using the markdown syntax. It gives a nice highlighted box to write in.

# Below is using hashtags to change the style of each heading.

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

You can use double asterisk to **bold** words or use the underscore before and after for 
_italicize_ the word. You can also use the `back quote` to highlight a text in red.

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

For URL you write in square brackets what you want to hyperlink and the url in parentheses/round 
brackets. You do the same thing but with a exclamation mark in front for images.

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
