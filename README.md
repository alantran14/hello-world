## Welcome to my first website

My name is Alan. This is my first website I am building using GitHub.

### Here is a quick Mathematics question with solution

```markdown

This is created using the markdown syntax. It gives a nice highlighted box to write in.

Below is using hashtags to change the style of each heading.

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

You can use double asterisk to **bold** words or use the underscore before and after for 
_italicize_ the word. You can also use the `back quote` to highlight a text in red.

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

For URL you write in square brackets what you want to hyperlink and the url in parentheses/round 
brackets. You do the same thing but with a exclamation mark in front for images.

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
